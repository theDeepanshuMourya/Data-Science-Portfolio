# Data-Science-Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of Data Science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. 
Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Supervised Learning - Boston House Price Prediction](/Boston%20House%20Price%20Prediction): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
	
	- [Unsupervised Learning - Click Through Rate (CTR) Prediction](/CTR%20Prediction): Developed a model to predict whether a particular internet user will click on the advertisement or not based on a dataset containing data of various customers.
	
	- [Deep Learning - Bank Churn Prediction](/Bank%20Churn%20Prediction): Designed and implemented an Artificial Neural Network that learns to predict customer churn using binary classification.
	
	- [Deep Learning - CNN Image Classifier(Cats vs Dogs)](/Cats-vs-Dogs): Designed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize images of cats and dogs and based on that learning predicts that a given image is of cat or dog.


Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Keras, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Featuretools

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation

	- [Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Analysis](/Titanic%20Analysis): Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.

Tools: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib

- ### Micro Projects

	- [ML with K-means Clustering](/ML%20Micro%20Projects/ML%20with%20K-means%20clustering): Using K-menas clustering to classify customer segments into different clusters based on their spending score.
